Some text.

## Formatting  {#sec-formatting}

::: aside
Note that each header automatically creates an anchor, making it easy to link to specific sections of your documents.
:::

Text can be rendered *in italic* or **in bold** as well as [underlined]{.underline}.

You can use superscripts^2^, subscripts~test~, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

> This is a quote.

## Columns

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
You can create columns.
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
And you can set their respective width.
:::

## Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Ordered lists

2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Images

## Tables

| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3  |
|------ |-------|--------|
| a     | 1     | red    |
| b     | 2     | orange | 
| c     | 3     | yellow |

:::{.callout-note}
Tables can be fully customized (or you could use raw html).

## Equations

$$
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm C^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C 
$$

## Cross-references

See @sec-formatting.

*Note that you can add bibliographies, flow charts, the equivalent of HTML "div", and just so much more. Remember that this is a tiny overview.*

## Let's try some code blocks now

```{r}
# This is a block that runs
2 + 3
```

::: aside
Did you notice that the content of your code blocks can be copied with a click?
Of course, this is customizable.
:::

```{.r}
# This is a block that doesn't run
2 + 3
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
# And this is a block showing only the output
data.frame(
  country = c("Canada", "USA", "Mexico"),
  var = c(2.9, 3.1, 4.5)
)
```

## Plots

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

<br>
You can play with options to add a title:

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Stopping distance as a function of speed in cars"

plot(cars)
```

<br>
You can have more complex multi-plot layouts:

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-cap: 
#|   - "Stopping distance as a function of speed in cars"
#|   - "Vapor pressure of mercury as a function of temperature"

plot(cars)
plot(pressure)
```

For those who have `ggplot2`[^1], you can try that too:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

[^1]: You can install it with:
    ```{.r}
    install.packages("ggplot2")
	```
