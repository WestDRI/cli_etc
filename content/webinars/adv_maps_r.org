Following our introductory webinar on GIS in R, this webinar will show an array of techniques to display GIS maps in R.

We will create inset maps, faceted maps, raster maps, animated maps, interactive mapping applications, cartograms, and bridge over from R to QGIS thanks to the packages sf, tmap, raster, leaflet, shiny, ggplot2, ggmap, grid, mapview, cartogram, and qgisprocess.

There is a lot to cover, so expect a much faster pace than last time!
