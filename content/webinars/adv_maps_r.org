This webinar will build upon our [[https://westgrid-cli.netlify.app/webinars/gis_r/][introduction to GIS in R]] and go much further:

# we will create inset maps, faceted maps, animated maps, interactive mapping applications, cartograms, raster maps, and bridge over from R to QGIS thanks to the packages sf, tmap, raster, leaflet, shiny, ggplot2, ggmap, grid, mapview, cartogram, and qgisprocess.

We will create inset maps, faceted maps, animated maps, cartograms, and raster maps. We will also add basemaps from OpenStreetMap and Google Maps.

All this thanks to the packages sf, tmap, raster, ggplot2, ggmap, grid, mapview, cartogram, and RgoogleMaps.

There is a lot to cover, so expect a much faster pace than in the introductory webinar!
