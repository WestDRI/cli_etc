#+BEGIN_definition
This webinar introduces basic GIS data manipulation and mapping in R with the packages ~sf~ and ~tmap~.

We will use data on the retreat of North American glaciers as an example.

* Datasets

A good starting place to look for open source GIS datasets is the  [[https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/][Free GIS Data]] page.

The datasets that we will use for this webinars are the Alaska and the Western Canada and USA subsets of the [[http://www.glims.org/RGI/][Randolph Glacier Inventory]] version 6.0{{<fl n="1">}} and the [[https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58af7022e4b01ccd54f9f542][USGS time series of the named glaciers of Glacier National Park]]{{<fl n="2">}}. These datasets can be downloaded as zip files from the respective websites.

For our basemap, we will use data from [[https://www.naturalearthdata.com/][Natural Earth]]. This dataset can be accessed direction from within R thanks to the packages ~rnaturalearth~ (which provides the functions) and ~rnaturalearthdata~ (which provides the data).

** Map of a single glacier

Each glacier has 4 borders: one for each year of survey. They are however quite hard to see on such a large map.

Let's zoom on the Agassiz glacier.

#+BEGIN_src R
## select the data points corresponding to the Agassiz Glacier
agassiz <- g %>% filter(glacname == "Agassiz Glacier")
#+END_src

And map it.

#+BEGIN_src R
tm_shape(ag) +
  tm_polygons("year", palette = "Blues") +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Agassiz Glacier",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
    legend.title.color = "#fcfcfc",
    legend.text.size = 1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.07, 0.03, 0.07, 0.03),
    outer.margins = 0
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    text.size = 0.7
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM"),
    text.size = 1
  )
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_note
Note: I didn't want to show the legend title and because there is no option to remove it, I set its color to that of the background.
