* Getting data

The datasets that we will use for this webinar are the Alaska as well as the Western Canada and USA subsets of the [[http://www.glims.org/RGI/][Randolph Glacier Inventory]] version 6.0{{<fl n="1">}} and the [[https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58af7022e4b01ccd54f9f542][USGS time series of the named glaciers of Glacier National Park]]{{<fl n="2">}}. These datasets can be downloaded as zip files from their respective websites.

For our basemap, we will use data from [[https://www.naturalearthdata.com/][Natural Earth]]. This dataset can be accessed direction from within R thanks to the packages /rnaturalearth/ (which provides the functions) and /rnaturalearthdata/ (which provides the data).

* Loading and exploring data

First, let's load the necessary packages for this webinar:

#+BEGIN_src R
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(purrr)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
#+END_src

We will start by mapping the data contained in the Alaska and the Western Canada and USA subsets of the [[http://www.glims.org/RGI/][Randolph Glacier Inventory]], i.e. all the glaciers of Western North America.

Data get imported and turned into /sf/ objects by the function ~sf::st_read()~:

#+BEGIN_src R
ak <- st_read("01_rgi60_Alaska")
wes <- st_read("02_rgi60_WesternCanadaUS")

ak
wes

str(ak)
str(wes)
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_note~
Note: ~02_rgi60_WesternCanadaUS~ and ~01_rgi60_Alaska~ are the 2 directories containing the downloaded and unzipped datasets. Make sure to use the absolute paths or the proper paths relative to your working directory (which can be obtained with ~getwd()~ and modified with ~setwd()~).
#+END_note

/sf/ objects are data.frame-like objects with a ~geometry~ list-column as their last column. That column is itself an object of class /sfc/ (simple feature geometry list column).

* Mapping with tmap

/tmap/ follows a grammar of graphic similar to that of /ggplot2/: you first need to set a shape (a spatial data object) by passing an /sf/ object to ~tm_shape()~. Then you plot one or several layers with one of several /tmap/ functions and you use the ~+~ sign between each element.

To see the available options, run:

#+BEGIN_src R
?tmap-element
#+END_src

We could thus plot the glaciers of Alaska with any of the options below:

#+BEGIN_src R
tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_borders()

tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_fill()

tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_polygons()      # shows both borders and fill
#+END_src

Here, we will use ~tm_polygons()~ which combines ~tm_borders()~ and ~tm_fill()~.

* Layout elements and attribute layers

A map without title, compass, or scale bars is not very useful though. We need to add layout elements and attribute layers to the map.

You can loop up the many arguments of the /tmap/ functions in the help pages to see how you can customize your maps:

#+BEGIN_src R
?tm_layout
?tm_compass
?tm_scale_bar
#+END_src

Let's now map the glaciers of Alaska:

#+BEGIN_src R
tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Glaciers of Alaska",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    title.size = 1.1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.06, 0.01, 0.09, 0.01),
    outer.margins = 0,
    frame.lwd = 0.2
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    size = 1.2,
    text.size = 0.6
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 500, 1000),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM")
  )
#+END_src

{{</img>}}

* Union of bounding boxes

Now, if we want to plot all the glaciers of Western North America, we want to combine both /sf/ objects in the same map. A map can contain multiple shapes: you only need to "add" a ~tm_shape~ and its element(s). Before doing so however, it is very important to ensure that they have the same coordinate reference system (CRS):

#+BEGIN_src R
st_crs(ak)
st_crs(wes)

st_crs(ak) == st_crs(wes)
#+END_src

They do, so we are good to go.

Note that, as with /ggplot2/ or GIS graphical user interfaces, the order matters since the layers stack up on top of each other.

#+BEGIN_src R
tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(wes) +
  tm_polygons()
#+END_src

If you run the code above however, you may be surprised that you are still only plotting the map of Alaska.

This is because each map comes with a spatial bounding box (~bbox~).

#+BEGIN_src R
st_bbox(ak)
st_bbox(wes)
#+END_src

In the code above, the ~bbox~ is set by the first shape, i.e. our entire map uses the ~bbox~ of the Alaska /sf/ object.

We first need to create a new bounding box encompassing both bounding boxes:

#+BEGIN_src R
nwa_bbox <- st_bbox(ak) %>%
  st_as_sfc() %>%
  st_union(st_as_sfc(st_bbox(wes))) %>%
  st_bbox()
#+END_src

We can now plot the glaciers of Western North America:

#+BEGIN_src R
tm_shape(ak, bbox = nwa_bbox) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(wes) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Glaciers of Western North America",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    title.size = 1.1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.06, 0.01, 0.09, 0.01),
    outer.margins = 0,
    frame.lwd = 0.2
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    size = 1.2,
    text.size = 0.6
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 1000, 2000),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM")
  )
#+END_src

* tmap maps with Leaflet

/tmap/ has 2 modes: /plot/ and /view/. \\
/plot/ is the default mode for static maps that we have used so far. \\
/view/ mode is an interactive viewing mode using [[https://leafletjs.com/][leaflet]] in a browser. There, you can zoom in/out, select/deselect the different layers, and choose to display one of Esri.WorldGrayCanvas, OpenStreetMap, or Esri.WorldTopoMap basemaps.

You can toggle between the /plot/ and /view/ modes with ~ttm()~. \\
You can also switch to either mode with ~tmap_mode("view")~ and ~tmap_mode("plot")~.

#+BEGIN_src R
tmap_mode("view")
tmap_last()
#+END_src

{{<imgshadow src="/img/r_gis/nwa_leaflet.png" margin="5rem" title="" width="%" line-height="0rem">}}
{{</imgshadow>}}

Afterwards, if you want to create new static plots, don't forget to get back to /plot/ mode with either of:

#+BEGIN_src R
ttmp()
tmap_mode("plot")
#+END_src

* Maps based on an attribute variable

What is interesting about glacier maps is to see their evolution through time as glaciers retreat due to climate change. While the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) has an amazing map in terms of spacial coverage, it doesn't yet have much temporal data.

To look at glacier retreat, we will look at the [[https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58af7022e4b01ccd54f9f542][USGS time series of the named glaciers of Glacier National Park]]{{<fl n="2">}}. These 4 datasets have the contour lines of 39 glaciers for the years 1966, 1998, 2005, and 2015.

We could load and clean these datasets one by one. Copying and pasting code however is inefficient and error-prone. A better approach is to do this in a functional programming framework: create a function which does all the data loading and cleaning, then pass each element of a vector of the paths of all 4 datasets to it using ~purrr::map()~.

"Cleaning" here consists of selecting the variables we are interested in, putting them in the same order in each dataset (they were not initially) and giving the exact same name across all datasets (there were case inconsistencies between datasets and R is case sensitive).

#+BEGIN_src R
## create a function that reads and cleans the data
prep <- function(dir) {
  g <- st_read(dir)
  g %<>% rename_with(~ tolower(gsub("Area....", "area", .x)))
  g %<>% select(
    year,
    objectid,
    glacname,
    area,
    shape_leng,
    x_coord,
    y_coord,
    source_sca,
    source
  )
}

## create a vector of dataset names
dirs <- grep("GNPglaciers_.*", list.dirs(), value = T)

## pass each element of that vector through prep() thanks to map()
gnp <- map(dirs, prep)
#+END_src

~map()~ returns a list, so we now have a list (~gnp~) of 4 elements: the 4 /sf/ objects containing our cleaned datasets. A list is not really convenient and we will turn it into a single /sf/ object.

Before doing so however, we want to make sure that they all have the same CRS:

#+BEGIN_src R
st_crs(gnp[[1]]) == st_crs(gnp[[2]])
st_crs(gnp[[1]]) == st_crs(gnp[[3]])
st_crs(gnp[[1]]) == st_crs(gnp[[4]])
#+END_src

They do, so we can turn ~gnp~ into a single /sf/ object:

#+BEGIN_src R
gnp <- do.call("rbind", gnp)

gnp
str(gnp)
#+END_src

We can now map the data:

#+BEGIN_src R
tm_shape(gnp) +
  tm_polygons("year", palette = "Blues") +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Glaciers of Glacier National Park",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    legend.title.color = "#fcfcfc",
    legend.text.size = 1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.07, 0.03, 0.07, 0.03),
    outer.margins = 0
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    text.size = 0.7
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 10, 20),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM"),
    text.size = 1
  )
#+END_src

#+BEGIN_note
Note: I didn't want to show the legend title and because there is no option to remove it, I set its color to that of the background.
#+END_note

* Mapping a subset of the data

Each glacier has 4 borders: one for each year of survey. They are however quite hard to see on such a large map.

Let's zoom on the Agassiz glacier:

#+BEGIN_src R
## select the data points corresponding to the Agassiz Glacier
ag <- g %>% filter(glacname == "Agassiz Glacier")
#+END_src

And map it:

#+BEGIN_src R
tm_shape(ag) +
  tm_polygons("year", palette = "Blues") +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Agassiz Glacier",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
    legend.title.color = "#fcfcfc",
    legend.text.size = 1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.07, 0.03, 0.07, 0.03),
    outer.margins = 0
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    text.size = 0.7
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM"),
    text.size = 1
  )
#+END_src

{{<img src="/img/r_gis/ag.png" margin="5rem" title="" width="50%" line-height="0rem">}}
{{</img>}}

Now we can clearly see the retreat of the Agassiz Glacier between 1966 and 2015.
