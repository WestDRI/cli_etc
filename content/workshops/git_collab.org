Git is a powerful version control system allowing to record, access, and restore the history of projects.

After setting up remotes on the internet or other network, Git is also a mighty collaboration tool.

In this workshop, we will use the popular online hosting site GitHub to practice a collaboration workflow typical of research teams.
