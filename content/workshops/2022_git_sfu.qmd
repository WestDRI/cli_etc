## Abstract

{{<def>}}
Git is a free and open source version control system (a software that tracks changes to your files, allowing you to revisit or revert to older versions).

Using Internet hosting services such as GitHub, Git is also a powerful collaboration tool.

In this introductory workshop you will learn the basics of working with Git on the command line.
