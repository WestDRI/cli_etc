In this lesson, you will apply what we just covered together to create a project, put it under version control, and start recording its history.

* Create a project

First, you need to create a toy project.

Navigate to the location where you want to create your project:

#+BEGIN_src sh
cd </path/where/you/want/to/have/your/project>
#+END_src

Create a new directory with the name of your project. *Never use spaces in names or paths.*

#+BEGIN_src sh
mkdir 
#+END_src

* Put your project under version control with Git



#+BEGIN_src sh
git init
#+END_src


* Create several commits



#+BEGIN_src sh
git status
#+END_src


#+BEGIN_src sh
git add File
#+END_src



#+BEGIN_src sh
git commit -m "Added File"
#+END_src


* Look at your commit history



#+BEGIN_src sh
git log
#+END_src

* Inspect a particular commit

#+BEGIN_src sh
git show
#+END_src

* Comments & questions
