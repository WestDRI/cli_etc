** Why R?

There are other high level programming languages such as Python or Julia, so when might it make sense for you to turn to R?

Here are a number of good reasons:

- Free and open source
- Unequalled number of statistics and modelling packages
- Integrated package manager
- Easy connection with fast compiled languages such as C and C++
- Powerful IDEs available (RStudio, Emacs ESS)

** For whom?

For whom is R particularly well suited?

- Fields with heavy statistics, modelling, or Bayesian analysis such as biology, linguistics, economics, or statistics
- Data science using a lot of tabular data

** Downsides of R

Of course, R also has its downsides:

- Inconsistent syntax full of quirks
- Slow
- Large memory usage
