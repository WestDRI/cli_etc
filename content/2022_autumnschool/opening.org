* Running R interactively

There are several ways to run R.

- Directly in the *console* (the name for the R shell):

- In {{<a "https://jupyter.org/" "Jupyter">}} with the R kernel ({{<a "https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/IRkernel/index.html" "IRkernel package">}}).
- In the RStudio IDE.
- In an other IDE (e.g. in Emacs with {{<a "https://ess.r-project.org/" "ESS">}}).

The RStudio IDE is popular and this is what we will use today. RStudio can can be run locally, but for this course, we will use an RStudio server.

Note that you can also run R scripts with:

#+BEGIN_src R
Rscript my_script.R
#+END_src
