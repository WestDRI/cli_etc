** Any questions so far?

I will answer questions about the material covered so far. If some things didn't make sense, the practice we will do together should help clarify everything.

** Let's try it together

Now we will put into practice what you just learnt: we will create a project, put it under version control, and start recording its history.

The key commands for this lesson are:

- ~git init~, which initiates a Git repository,
- ~git status~, ~git add~, ~git commit~, ~git diff~, ~git log~, and ~git show~, which you read about in the previous lesson.

This is what our live session might look like:

#+BEGIN_src sh
cd /path/to/suitable/dir
mkdir snow_level
cd snow_level
pwd

git init
git status

mkdir data ms output src
git status

nano src/script.py
git status

git add src/script.py
git status

git commit -m $'Initial commit\n
\n
Add first draft of Python script'

git status
git log

nano ms/paper.md
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Add first draft of manuscript"
git status

nano src/script.py
git status
git add src/script.py
git status
git diff
git diff --cached
git diff HEAD

git log
git show HEAD
#+END_src
